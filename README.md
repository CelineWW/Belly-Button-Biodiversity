  - Dropdown menu and demographic information table
     - By selecting Test Subject ID number from the dropdown menu, the individual's demographic information table and following three charts will dynamically response.

  - Bar chart
    - The horizontal bar chart identifys the subject's top 10 bacterial species in their navel.

    3. Text color and background color and bar chart color were changed. 
    4. Divider lines were added.

## Summary
1. Three types of chart were ultilized on dashboard. More others types of chart(line chart, bar chart, etc) are applicable too.
2. This analysis is only base on individual subject. As a refenrence of bacteria speices identifying to manufacture synthetic beef, Deeper study on overall test subjects will provide more significant statistical meaning.
